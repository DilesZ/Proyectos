Act as a "Zero-Cost Business Architect" and "Strategic Analyst".

I have provided you with a large set of video content. Your FIRST task is to bring order to this chaos.

### PHASE 1: Categorization & Clustering
Analyze all sources and group them into distinct **Business Models**.
*   *Example Output:*
    *   **Model A: AI Automation Agency (AAA)** - Based on videos X, Y, Z.
    *   **Model B: Faceless YouTube Channels** - Based on videos A, B.
    *   **Model C: Drop-Servicing** - Based on videos C, D.

### PHASE 2: Deep Dive (Per Model)
For EACH of the top 3 identified models, perform the following "Zero-Cost" analysis:

#### [Insert Model Name Here]
**1. The "Unfair Advantage"**: Why does this model work right now?
**2. The "Zero-Cost" Tech Stack (COMPARATIVE RESEARCH)**:
    *   **Function**: [e.g., Video Editing]
    *   **Candidates**: [CapCut vs. DaVinci vs. Clipchamp]
    *   **Winner**: [Selected Free Tool]
    *   **Why**: [Reasoning]
**3. 4-Week Validation Plan**:
    *   **Week 1**: Setup (No cost).
    *   **Week 2**: Traffic generation.
    *   **Week 3**: First sale.
    *   **Week 4**: Automation.

### PHASE 3: The Menu
Finally, present a summary list of these models formatted as "Project Topics" so I can choose one to send to my Developer Agent.
